# MapBox iPhone touch test

A MapBox element, embedded within a particular layout, is unable to respond to touch events in Safari and Chrome on the iPhone.

I had tried to create a test page on CodePen but couldn't reproduce the bug there.  I suspected I wouldn't have better luck with other pastebins, so I instead created a standalone test page:  https://mapbox-touch-test.netlify.com/

The associated issue ticket for Mapbox GL JS is [here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/4898).
